# Yokai-Watch-3-Save-Editor
This is a rehost of @togenyan's former Yo-kai Watch 3 save editor, which was removed from his Github on December 20, 2018. This is the most stable version of the save editor, compatible with the EU (@justin102955)

HOW TO USE IT

You need to have a .yw's savefile (obtained by doing a backup from your 2ds/3ds with checkpoint by example)
Launch the save editor and open the savefile 
After you have done the modifications of the savefile, save it and restore the modified savefile (with checkpoint) on your game
